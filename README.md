# Express server with exercises for JavaScript and express

In this repository you learn the basics about JavaScript and express.
Basic knowledge of programming in any language is required.

It is divided in two exercise sections:
1. JavaScript exercises from `consol.log()` to array transformation with `.reduce()`.
2. Express from `GET` endpoints to error handlers

## How to get started

1. Clone this repository - `git clone`
2. Create and checkout your own branch - `git checkout -b <your-branch-name>` ([git branch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches), [git checkout](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-checkout))
3. Start the express server with `npm start` from the root directory
4. Start Postman and import the `javascript-exercises.postman_collection.json` - [Import Postman Collections](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#importing-postman-data)
5. Solve the exercises in the respective .js files
   - JavaScript `src/exercises/node-exercises.js`
   - Express `src/exercises/express-exercises.js`

## Additional notes

To execute your code, run the exercise request in Postman.
The exercises build on top of each other and provide the necessary resources to solve them.
